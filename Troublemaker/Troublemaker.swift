/**
 The responsible for injecting(adding) and removing Warning and Errors in Xcode.
 
 In this project `Warnings` and `Errors` are collectively called `Issues`.
 
 #### How it works
 It starts being initialized with an instance of type NSWindowController.
 It fails if the instance passed as parameter is not an
 `IDEWorkspaceWindowController` (private class) object.
 
 This happens because `Troublemaker` can only work if it gets access to Xcode's
 window controller.
 
 An instance of NSWindowController can be usually obtained by calling:
 ```
 NSApp.keyWindow?.windowController
 ```
 #### Important
 This project is usseful only if the caller can get access to Xcode's window
 controller. The only known way to do this is from a Xcode plugin.
